    <div class="box-container">
        <div class="box">
            <div class="image">
                <img src="image/cafena.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>I wanted to take this time to let you know how grateful we are to have you choosing us for your
                        coffee needs. Quality coffee is a passion for me and I am so thankful for your patronage which
                        allows me to do this. I wanted to share a little about our coffees, and why I think they are so
                        special. First of all, we buy our coffee from only the most reputable farms and mills in Kona.
                        Being a teacher in Kona for three decades, I taught some of the farmers and some of their
                        parents too - which goes a long way.
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>Not Too Small:</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>Most boutique coffee companies sell an estate coffee, called this because every bean comes from
                        their estate which may be an acre or two of planted coffee - exactly how we started out. When
                        the beans are picked and dried, they end up in a variety of sizes or grades. These boutique
                        companies roast all beans of varying size together because they cannot afford to waste any beans
                        regardless of quality and they don't have enough beans for it to make sense to separate them
                        into different grades.</li>
                    <li>What you end up with is an inconsistent roast - the larger beans might not be roasted enough,
                        while the smaller beans are roasted too much and taste burnt. Our “Estate” coffee is from a
                        single grade so you get a much more uniform roast at the perfect temperature for that size.
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>Not Too Big:</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>The largest companies must buy huge amounts of coffee bean as cheaply as possible, which
                        typically results in lower quality beans. Low quality beans have less flavor, so these companies
                        roast the coffee darker to hide imperfections in the coffee and eke out as much flavor as
                        possible, regardless of what that flavor ends up being. But the flavor you often taste is
                        over-roasted or burnt. Consider a top grade tuna or beef.</li>
                    <li>Connoisseurs typically prefer these items undercooked than overcooked, so they can enjoy the
                        natural flavors of the cut. Overcooked, you typically end up with a charred piece of meat that's
                        less flavorful and more burnt. Same thing with coffee. If you've ever had Starbucks coffee you
                        might already be familiar with the burnt taste I'm talking about, which they hide with caramel,
                        whip cream, and other goodies. There is nothing wrong with that. It's just not what we do.
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>Our Coffee Is Just Right:</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>We buy only from reputable farmers and millers at volumes equal to several hundred acres. We
                        grade our coffees into different sizes and quality, throw out the lower quality beans and blind
                        taste our grades and types individually to find the best roasting temperature that bring out the
                        best taste for that specific size and coffee bean - different roasting temperatures for
                        different coffee. We do this constantly to maintain a consistent and high-quality roast every
                        time.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>We Roast Only What We Immediately Need And Age The Rest:</h3>
            <div class="content">
                <ul>
                    <li>You may have waited a bit longer for your coffee but we can guarantee you received the freshest
                        coffee anywhere. Even though our roasted coffee can be stored for 4 - 6 months in a cool, dry
                        place, we don't warehouse roasted coffee. Even the coffee sold to stores are roasted and put
                        into stores well within a week. The coffee bean we buy, we typically don't roast immediately,
                        and instead age it for at least a year. Like a fine wine that gets better after some years
                        "resting" before being consumed, we feel our coffee is softer yet bigger because we age it to
                        reduce acids giving it a smoother taste. As you may have already experienced, you don't have to
                        add cream and sweetener to drink our coffee - it has a smoother and less acidic taste without
                        cream because of this aging process.
                    </li>
